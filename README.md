## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a rising junior at Cal Poly SLO studying computer engineering. As a tech enthusiast, I love exploring new areas of computer engineering and finding ways to apply technology for social good. I believe that technology can be a powerful tool for making the world a better place, and I'm always looking for opportunities to use my skills to contribute to that goal.

In addition to my interest in computer engineering, I'm also passionate about graphic design. I enjoy creating visual designs that are both aesthetically pleasing and functional, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills in this area.

Thanks for stopping by, and I look forward to connecting with you! ðŸ˜„
